.B simple_shell
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B ./hsh
[command] [options]
.SH DESCRIPTION
The shell is a command-line interpreter or shell that provides a command line user interface for Unix-like operating systems.
The shell is both an interactive command language and a scripting language, and is used by the operating system to control the execution of the system using shell scripts.

.B Interactive mode
The commands are run with user-interaction from keyboard. 
E.g. the shell can prompt the user to enter input.

.B Non-interactive mode
The shell is probably run from an automated process so it can't assume if can request input or that someone will see the output.
E.g Maybe it is best to write output to a log-file.
