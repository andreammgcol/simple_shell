# Simple Shell
This project is the most important of the first trimester of Holberton School, is the consolidation of everything we learned in the quarter about System engineering & DevOps and Low-level programming & Algorithm.
Using C programming language, we develop our own Shell.

### Description
The shell is a command-line interpreter or shell that provides a command line user interface for Unix-like operating systems. The shell is both an interactive command language and a scripting language, and is used by the operating system to control the execution of the system using shell scripts.

### Installation
You can install the simple shell cloning this repo:
```sh
$ git clone https://github.com/andreammgcol/simple_shell.git
```
Next you can compile the files with this command:
```sh
$ gcc -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic *.c -o hsh
```
finally you can run our Shell writing:
```sh
./hsh
```

### Built with
This project was built and development with:
- `C programming language:` is a general-purpose, procedural computer programming language supporting structured programming, lexical variable scope, and recursion, while a static type system prevents unintended operations.
- `VirtualBox:` VirtualBox is a general-purpose full virtualizer for x86 hardware, targeted at server, desktop and embedded use.
- `Vagrant:` Managing virtual machine environments.
- `Ubuntu 14.04 LTS:` Operating system tester and working.

- `GCC:` GNU Compiler version 4.8.4
